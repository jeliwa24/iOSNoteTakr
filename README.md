iOSNotes
========

final project for iOS -- Jessica Wang jlw2197

The app features a tableview where the user can add / delete a list of notes. Once the user chooses the note, the app goes to a more detailed view of the note, with an editable title, text field for the note, the ability to add an image, and to send the note as an email. The user can add an existing image from the photo library by tapping the corresponding area or the user can take a new photo. The detailed view is scrollable. 

The app uses NSCoding and the filesystem to save persistent data and images. 

(Note: I was not able to test taking a picture with camera since the simulator does not support camera, but choosing from photo library works.)
